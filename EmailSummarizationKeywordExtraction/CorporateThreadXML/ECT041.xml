</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_007">I think we can help.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_008">My question is, who is this  opinion going to be given on behalf of.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_009">If it is from the City of  Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's "bond  counsel" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal  finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't  going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were  going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_010">We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to  Glendale, but perhaps not.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_011">Let me know how we can help.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_020">Things have gone a little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_021">My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is: Do you really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_022">Wouldn't you rather turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_023">In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_024">What good is it if it just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_025">My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside financing counsel.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_026">That should give you a clear signal whether outside counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's opinion.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_027">Sorry I am not being more help on this.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT041_028">Let me know if there is more to talk about.
