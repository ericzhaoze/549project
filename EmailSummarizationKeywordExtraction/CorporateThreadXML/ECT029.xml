</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_002">I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter  relating  to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed  but  were not in a position to resolve at the time.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_003">These are:   (1) Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14  of  the Agreement).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_004">I recall that we were discussing the possible use  of  arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the  OSLA)  so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the  Terms of Business Letter.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_005">Since we ultimately agreed to English  courts,  I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will  prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_006">(2) Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner  as  Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_007">I believe that  you  and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_008">Why shouldn't  these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_009">I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the  account documentation.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_010">Regards.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_012">Arbitration -  more  appropriate to general terms of business which principally  contemplate  the  regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_013">In the event  of  inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_014">I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_016">It seems to me that the terms of the PB  conflict  because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i) J14 conflicts with Par.8  requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the  Terms of  Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_017">Are  you agreeing with this analysis?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_018">Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict  with  the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB  (except  for silence on the matter).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_019">You didn't address this point.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_020">It is  Enron  Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the  Terms  of Business in the same manner.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_021">Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11? or suggest  a  different time?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_022">I am not trying to belabor execution of the the  remaining  documents.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_024">There may be non-prime brokerage issues that  relate to  the terms of business.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_025">Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the  PB  relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_026">Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately  addressed  in the documentation as drafted.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_027">I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible  so we  can try to get this wrapped up today.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_029">Unfortunately, the outstanding issues relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_030">If you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_031">Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_032">We do have other business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation of liability language in the terms of business letter.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_033">I propose:  "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_034">Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_035">I will be out of the office 9/18/01 in the a.m.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT029_036">All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed together with the terms of business letter.
