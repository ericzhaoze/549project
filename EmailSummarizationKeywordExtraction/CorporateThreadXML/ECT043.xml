</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_041">What's the format for the presentations?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_042">Will there be a Q&amp; A after the presentation?
</sentence><signature>Many Thanks, Liz </signature></text></email><email order="6"><date> Thu, 20 Dec 2001 09:01:20 -0800 (PST)</date><from> Liz.M.Taylor@enron.com [mailto:Liz.M.Taylor@enron.com]On Behalf Of</from><to> &lt;Greg.Whalley@enron.com</to><subject> RE: FW: Interactive Energy Keynote Session</subject><text><sentence id="ECT043_043">Liz,  We're considering one of two options:  In the first, Greg would make an independent 20 to 25-minute presentation followed with 10 to 15 minutes of Q&amp;A.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_044">Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger, will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace representing $120 billion in annual spending.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_045">Tim will be followed by a McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the energy industry.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_046">Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether we start upstream and move down, or vice versa.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_047">We finish at 11:00.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_048">In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_049">Under this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_050">The director then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at Texaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource Management Services.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_051">Each executive would have 10-15 minutes to discuss his business model and the key issues that the industry must consider during the next year, followed by Q&amp;A to the entire panel.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_052">Let me know if Greg has a preference to one of these two scenarios and we'll try to accommodate it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_053">About the audience: The audience is consistently made up of a confluence of energy and technology executives.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_054">About 30% will be comprised of energy professionals interested in wholesale and retail trading.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_055">For example, we already have some 70 European gas and electricity executives scheduled to attend.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_056">Cisco's London Office is arranging a Pan American tour for these executives with a stop at Interactive Energy.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_057">Many other wholesale and retail merchants will also be in attendance, including some large industrial buyers.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_058">Heads of energy procurement from Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall's (an eight-state buying consortium's) have attended in the past.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT043_059">Please let me know if you have further questions.
