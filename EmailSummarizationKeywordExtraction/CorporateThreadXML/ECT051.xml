</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_015">I assume that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_016">Given the cumulative size of these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_017">Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_018">I wouldn't want to allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_019">In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts due and owing?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_020">If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_021">Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court approval to return these funds.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT051_022">Thanks.
