</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_002">I'm working on getting you a ETA.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_003">I've been working on  getting access to the data I need for the project.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_004">I got approval today and should be able to provide you with a  estimate by Friday.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_005">I apologize for the delay but am certain you'll be happy with  the result.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_007">I've access to the MKM data sources and am investigating what  resides there and how  it can be requested and assembled.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_008">I spoke to Thomas  yesterday and it looks like they  have all the ERMS curves and can convert the curve amounts  into any currency so Frankie's  rate service might not be required afterall.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_009">My hope is to use MKM to retrieve the data sets as XML, smash  them together on time boundaries,  and use XSLT to peform simple math, translation and  presentation functions.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_010">I've updated Tori that I now have access to the datasource  and am looking into what's  there and how to assemble it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_011">Fortunately for me she's been  very patient -- as I've not been  able to provide her with an estimate yet, but will do so as  soon as I understand what's all involved.

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_014">This was resolved last week Thursday.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_015">I've put together a project plan and have estimated dates for each task below.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT038_017">2. Merge curves together (11/21) 3. Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21) 4. Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26) 5. Perform all math needed.
