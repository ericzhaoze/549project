I have an email out to Mark Holsworth in Legal asking if  there will be fees charged back to your group for pursuing  "enronemissions.com".
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_009">My guess is no, but I'll pass Mark's  answer on to you.   
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_010">2. We did secure the four domain names we discussed (listed  below).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_011">Shall I go forward with hooking them up to the site  at http://www.enron.com/wholesale/emissions/?   
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_012">3. Are these new domain names part of a larger plan in your  group to promote your site and/or send potential customers to  it?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_013">You may want to get with Juli Salvagio in Wholesale  Marketing -- she's a great resource for cooking up  coordinated marketing approaches.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_014">We work with her on all  the Wholesale sites.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_015">4. You mentioned that you found some old content through the  search engine.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_016">We are in the process of tracking that down.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_017">If you remember what you typed into the search box that  would be helpful.

If an a fee is involved, we would definitely like to  know before pursuing anything.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_019">2.) Yes, please hook that up.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_020">3.) Yes.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_021">I have had numerous conversations with Juli Salvagio.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_022">4.) http://www.ect.enron.com/products/emissions/overview.fset.html
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_023">Also, please inform me if our group has incurred any costs or  will incur costs by requesting something done.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_025">So I'm expecting the answer "no chargeback" from Legal.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_026">But I'll let you know.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_027">Do you remember what you typed into the search box?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_028">I tried "emissions" and did not come across old content.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT058_029">I understand that the page you cite is out there, and we can take it down, but I also want to fix whatever led the search engine to return that page.
