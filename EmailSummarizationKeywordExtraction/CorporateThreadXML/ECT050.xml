Any word yet about the cell phones?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_013">I'm getting nervous, as are a lot of others, I'm sure.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_014">Some people in my group are really wanting to keep their phones, and they are asking me questions that I don't know the answers to ... like what kinds of rate changes there will be, as well as to what point will the liability be theirs, and how far back will they have to pay to get the invoices current, if Enron has not done so already.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_015">How are you affected by this?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_016">Will Cingular find another business that you will work out of?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_017">Just curious.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_019">We will have some in our office tomorrow around 1 (ran out today) and they can also pick one up at a Cingular store.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_020">Just make sure that they mail them back to me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_021">My home address is: 4501 Shetland Houston 77027 As for the cancellation of the corporate phones, that is not scheduled to take place yet, and may not right away.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_022">If they just want to do a rate plan change, then they can do it via email (have them email me) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_023">The main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability, which also obligates them for one year.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_024">As for the balances accrued up to date, they are not responsible for those.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_025">Enron is.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_026">Good luck to you.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_027">I hope you get my email and I hope I get to see you again.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT050_028">And, yes, I will be getting all new accounts now!
