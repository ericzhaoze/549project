</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_008">I have checked my   files and those maintained by Tana Jones in relation to EOL contracts   and amendments.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_009">I have also asked Leslie Hansen about this matter.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_010">Unfortunately, we do not have any files for Austin Energy nor can we   locate any information on negotiations associated with the EOL   contract.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_011">Information on counterparties is maintained in our   database for all counterparties we are contracting with or contracted   with and Austin Energy does not show up.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_012">If AE has information that we have looked at in the past, the only   thing I can do is ask that it be forwarded to me for review.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT039_013">Though I   will be out of the office tomorrow, I will give this matter my full   attention once I have the necessary information.
