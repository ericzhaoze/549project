</sentence><sentence id="ECT052_010">I don't think there would be any system changes required.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT052_011">Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT052_012">If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT052_013">Elizabeth, Is this correct?
</sentence><sentence id="ECT052_014">I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.
