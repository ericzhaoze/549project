</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_005">UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_006">You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_007">The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_008">Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_009">It sounds very interesting to me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_010">Let me know what you think.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT047_011">I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.
