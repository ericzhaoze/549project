He spent three amazing days at Porlock Vale and describes his experience in detail. The property is owned by a bright and professional couple (Helen and Kim). The house and grounds are immaculate. It is in the Exmoor National Forest, directly on the coast. Jeff had an awesome horse-riding treat there.</abstractive><extractive_sentences><sentence rank="5">EPT043_009</sentence><sentence rank="4">EPT043_006</sentence><sentence rank="3">EPT043_003</sentence><sentence rank="2">EPT043_002</sentence><sentence rank="1">EPT043_001</sentence></extractive_sentences><keyword_keyphrase><keyword rank="5">wines</keyword><keyword rank="4">grass paddocks</keyword><keyword rank="3">horses</keyword><keyword rank="2">Exmoor National Forest</keyword><keyword rank="1">Porlock Vale</keyword></keyword_keyphrase></annotation><annotation email="EPT044" annotator="1"><abstractive>Kristin met John while talking to Paul Racicot ath Front Porch Pub.

Matt is working in Freight, and they are not well off these days. Kristin was wondering if John had any positions available in his area. Her title is Specialist, she enjoys trading, and she is not ready to leave Enron behind yet. Unfortunately, John does not have any opening in his group right now.

Peder has disappeared, his e-mail address no longer works, and t.d. should hopefully come back for good. Enron is melting down due to a fraud with their upper management. It is one of the largest collapses in American business. Forseberg is taking some time away from hockey. He will either be back soon, or he might take the whole year off.</abstractive><extractive_sentences><sentence rank="5">EPT045_013</sentence><sentence rank="4">EPT045_012</sentence><sentence rank="3">EPT045_006</sentence><sentence rank="2">EPT045_005</sentence><sentence rank="1">EPT045_001</sentence></extractive_sentences><keyword_keyphrase><keyword rank="5">melt down</keyword><keyword rank="4">enron</keyword><keyword rank="3">forseberg</keyword><keyword rank="2">peder</keyword><keyword rank="1">broncos</keyword></keyword_keyphrase></annotation></root>
