</subject><text><sentence id="EPS060_001">OK folks, Here's the scoop on Drallion Tickets.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_002">- In order to give the momma to be enough time to recover (she is due on the 11th), I began my search for shows beginning on Jan 13th.  2 days should be enough time right?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_003">I'm kidding, I actually began searching for shows on Jan 25th (Friday) 
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_004">- Searching for tix on line it appears that Friday and Saturday tix would be hard to get for a big group.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_005">I have contacted group sales to see if they have anything available.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_006">- There are weekday shows that we may want to consider.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_007">There are still plenty of good seats for some of the weekday shows (even for a large group).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_008">Unfortunately, the maximum number of tix I can get through direct online is 12.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_009">I may ask the group sales rep about possibly getting more.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_010">- Showtimes that are convenient for us (it would be pretty hard to get us all downtown at 5:00 on a weekday): Tuesday and Wednesdays - 8:00pm Thursday and Friday - 9:00 pm Saturday - 4:00 or 8:00pm 
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_011">A Thursday show may be best in that we can meet for dinner before the show.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_012">- Now here is the fun part.... Good seats are $60.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_013">These are tix located directly in front of the stage.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_014">The cheapest seats (limited view) are $40.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_015">Please let me know if you are still in and if you have any preference on seat location ($) and date (day).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_016">Please reply ASAP so that I can order these tix.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS060_017">This is a list of people that have showed interest in going: Kevin and Nancy Dutch and Kay Mark and Bebe Ernie and Melissa Joe and Yesenia (Xavier?) Ricardo and Joann
