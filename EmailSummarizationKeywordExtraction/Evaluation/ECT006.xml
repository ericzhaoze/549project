</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_013">Thanks for your kind words about Enron.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_014">Every business  hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing  sleep over it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_015">I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs  and references to LTCM and MG.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_018">I will adapt the memo to our clients to make  it  more neutral.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_019">I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one  of my  associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_020">He is now  working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on  Friday.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_021">He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did  not have  enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might  turn  into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite  different in  its structural aspects).
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_022">Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can  call DC  any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have  someone like  me as a side channel.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_023">If I can be useful in this channel let me know.
</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_024">All the best.

</sentence><sentence id="ECT006_026">I have forwarded your message to Mark Palmer, our press spokesman.
