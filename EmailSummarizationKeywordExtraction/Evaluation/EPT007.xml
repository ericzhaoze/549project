Mendoza/MDACC@MDACC</to><subject>  pain in the ....</subject><text><sentence id="EPT007_001">I think I'm going to have to quit tennis.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_002">My back hurts every time I play a match.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_003">It even hurts from yesterday's drill.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_004">I think it is best if I drop out of all the organized tennis I've signed up for this month.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_005">Danny is going to hate me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_006">Maybe he would let you sub in for me for the 4.5 singles tournament, since no one has played any matches yet (assuming you want to play).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_007">Ugh.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_008">I really hate to not play tennis but I have to make this back last for 35+ more years!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_009">So it's just not worth it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_010">Good to see you looking so happy yesterday!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_011">we need to find you a man in Houston.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_012">If/when you want me to set you up with my friend, let me know!

</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_014">The cold doesn't help the stiffness, either.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_015">I'm already playing HTA league, and I'm just still not interested in hanging out at the Met much.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_016">I don't think I'm going to play Kingwood, either.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_017">I'll make a decision by tomorrow - I just really want to get out of town.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_018">I want you to tell me more about this friend of yours.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_019">What happened with Diana?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_020">What does he look like?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_021">What does he do?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_022">How long have you known him - TELL ME THE SCOOP!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_023">After Craig, who is still the most gorgeous man I have ever been out with, it's just so difficult to see myself with anyone right now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_024">I know I need to move on, and he'll come back when he's ready, IF I am available.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_025">Tell me - and if we do go out, we HAVE to double - I need to meet Craig anyway......

</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_027">He looks very Italian.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_028">I've known him most of the time I've been at Enron; first met him when he was dating (i.e., going out on just a few dates with) my friend Staci.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_029">He is very fun and very sweet but just a tad bit flighty; still think he has some growing up to do.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_030">That's why I warned Dianna that he would probably just be someone to go out on a few dates with, for fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_031">I really don't think he's ready to settle down at all.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_032">On the other hand, he's fun to be with, and has a way of making you feel that you're the only woman in the room.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_033">That kind of attention (the lighthearted, no-strings-attached kind) might be just what you need right now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_034">The problem with Dianna was that she instantly fell in love with him, and of course was very frustrated when he did not call every day or want to hang out all the time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_035">She finally started acting a little cold towards him.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_036">His take on the situation: she expects too much!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_037">The only difficulty might be that John could be leery of dating my friends by now!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_038">But I can test the waters and let you know...

</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_040">I'd like to meet this guy, though, since you do know him.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_041">Like you said, I'm NOT going to meet anyone in a bar.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_042">John doesn't have any kids, or x--wives does he?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_043">I was kinda interested in the manager of Sambuca, Charles (Chuck) Dearborn, and he seemed kinda interested in me, BUT then I found out he has an x-wife and 2 kids in another state.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_044">NO THANKS!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_045">Where is the line for baggage-free men???
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_046">I know we all have it, but just for once, I'd like to meet a man who can DEAL WITH HIS OWN...MATURELY!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_047">You're right, though, I need to try to date a guy with a "normal" job.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT007_048">I don't know what's wrong today, but I miss Craig so much right now.
