</subject><text><sentence id="EPS072_001">I got back from vacation late Friday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_002">Our whole group got bumped from the flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_003">Not a bad deal!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_004">But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was exhausted.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_005">Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover (and clean from my construction work).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_006">I had a really nice time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_007">Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except for the flight out of Munich.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_008">We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_009">My favorite time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_010">It was wonderful, I hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_011">It is so hard to do anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_012">Our hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast and dinner included!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_013">Such a deal!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_014">I got home and my house is almost done.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_015">There are only a few minor things left.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_016">The garden is at 85%.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_017">My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_018">I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I think (if the painter is done).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_019">They are calico cats.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_020">I haven't named them yet.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_021">What's going on with you?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_022">Are they working you to death?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS072_023">Any fun things going on?
