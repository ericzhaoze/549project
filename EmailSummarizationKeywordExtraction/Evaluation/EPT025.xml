</sentence><sentence id="EPT025_009">There are still several available, but if  we  didn't  have  your  2001 in stock, I would locate it at another dealer and  bring  it in  for  the  same price.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT025_010">The next step might also be to give me your top choices  for  colours  so  I  can  keep an eye out for you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT025_011">By the way, my work number is 730-4000, or toll-free  1-866-881-1888.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT025_024">If not, it is the 60th Anniversary Limited - black exterior with  the  taupe  and agate interior...
