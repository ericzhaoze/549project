</subject><text><sentence id="ECS043_001">I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.)
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_002">with respect to Utilicorp. "signing" the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_003">Actually what Utilicorp. did in this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 of the agreement).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_004">They signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_005">If we can get them to agree to the same language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better than getting a guaranty.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_006">Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_007">All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS043_008">Let me know if I can be of further service...
