</subject><text><sentence id="EPS101_001">Hello fellow equinephiles,  I received positive responses (Anything other than 'Yes' is bad, very, very bad - downright Negative) from Madeleine &amp; Rob, Nora, and Pat.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_002">Carl sounds like he is interested, but has other things on his mind at the moment.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_003">Alice has some silly concern about a roof over her head, saying that she needs to take care of the house first.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_004">If anyone else is considering the trip, please let me know soon.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_005">The big question is about the timing.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_006">Rob and Nora have expressed a preference for August.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_007">Pat is trying to get Intel to spring for her airfare by calling it a business trip (can you say, "Junket").
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_008">Because Pat has only the best interest of the company in mind, she feels April would be a good time to go.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_009">My preference is to go just before or after the tourist season, which would be the beginning of June or September.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_010">The folks at Porlock advised me thus: Depending on the wetness of the winter season, the outdoor jump arenas and x-country courses open in early May to early June.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_011">By mid June, the local tourist season is in full-swing.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_012">Bookings will be more difficult, and we will have to compete with a good bit of traffic on the roads and trails during hacks.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_013">Hikers use the same trails that we will canter.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_014">The tourist season lasts through August, when much of Europe and the UK are taking Summer holidays.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_015">So, please help me find a time that is suitable for everyone.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_016">My vote is to go at the end of August - Beginning of September.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS101_017">What do you think of that?
