</subject><text><sentence id="EPS070_001">Hi, sistas-  Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_002">We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_003">Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_004">$50 valet parking fee.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_005">I confirmed "17" with mom.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_006">Heidi sent some sample menus.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_007">A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree, dessert) is $45.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_008">A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_009">Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_010">The food sounds really good.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_011">So, here's a guess at cost: 17 people at $45 =  $765 Beverages =        $200 Gratuity =   $193 Valet =    $  50 Room rental =   $200 TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into thirds  What do you guys think?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_012">Should we explore other options - or just go with this?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_013">I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_014">So, if we really want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to consider other options.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS070_015">Thoughts?
