</subject><text><sentence id="EPS015_001">Hello, sistas-  Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_002">Here's some additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_003">1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual charge until the day of the event.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_004">2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3 entrees and 2 desserts.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_005">If we have a special request, we can let her know; otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has cookin' that night.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_006">3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_007">Preferences?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_008">4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in addition to the three course meal.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_009">She suggested oysters (for which they are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_010">These would be served as guests arrive.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_011">5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in advance of the event.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_012">Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in addition to wine.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_013">I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_014">I thought we might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the happy couple.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS015_015">Thoughts, everyone?
