</subject><text><sentence id="EPS026_001">Hello to all!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_002">Here is the promised email address book.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_003">There are still people missing, but it's a pretty good start.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_004">I will volunteer to be the keeper of the master list for a while, and will send out updates monthly or when needed to everyone.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_005">If there is anyone missing from the email list or something needs to be changed, please send it to me.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_006">If I should ever go back to work, I will find a volunteer in the family to be the master keeper of the list.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_007">I did receive an error on Vern, Brad and Greg when sending this email.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_008">Hopefully someone can send me their correct email address.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_009">I put this address book together to accomplish two things.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_010">First, I am writing a family cookbook so I need to be able to communicate individually with all of you.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_011">More on that later.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_012">Second, this should give the guys putting together the next reunion a little easier way to correspond with the family rather that having to mail to everyone.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_013">This way they only have to mail to those not on the list.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_014">Now, for what this list is not for.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_015">This is not for any of you to send group emails for jokes and cartoons, or chain letters.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_016">Some of the people on this list have given work email addresses.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_017">They cannot receive improper emails (especially if you work for the ATF).?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_018">If any of you do start receiving unwanted emails, please let that person know immediately to stop.??
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_019">If they do not stop, please let me know and we will remove them from the family email list.?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_020">Thanks to all of you that helped me to get this information.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_021">I am still working on getting more addresses, so let me know if you have any.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_022">For those of you that haven't heard this yet, I am trying to write a family cookbook.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_023">I am hoping to get the recipes for everything our parents used to make for us while we were growing up.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_024">I also want to get three or four of your own favorite recipes from each cousin.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_025">There will be other nice tidbits in the cookbook about everyone, maybe a story from when you were growing up?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_026">Or even something current in your life.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_027">I will not send out mass emails very often.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_028">I will be talking individually to each of you over the next couple of months.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_029">So for any of you that just can't wait for that individual contact, please send your recipes in now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_030">Bill Billinger is sending his this week, I think?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_031">This is exciting to me to get this address book out to all of you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_032">This is such an awesome family, and I love the fact that I can stay in touch with all of you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS026_033">If you need to call me, my phone number is 303-773-6021.
