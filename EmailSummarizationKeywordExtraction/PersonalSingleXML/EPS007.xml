</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_002">Kevie started school this week, and he moved closer to campus.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_003">His new contact information is:  2635 Portland Street, Apartment 5 Los Angeles, CA 90007  (213) 764-0150  Kevie now lives in South Central (aka Da 'Tto aka the Ghetto), so don't break your necks coming visit his new place.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_004">He's always up for hanging out away from his new location, though.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_005">Actually, the new place is not too bad.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_006">I have a roommate who I have not yet met, but the apartment is adequate.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_007">The bars on the windows are a lovely touch.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_008">For those CU alums in the LA area, I'm planning on hitting Grunyuns in Manhattan Beach on Sunday night to watch the Buffs game, so hopefully you other kids can make it, as well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS007_009">Talk at ya'll later.
