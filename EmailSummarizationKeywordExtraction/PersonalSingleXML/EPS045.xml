</subject><text><sentence id="EPS045_001">Hi, Sooz  Just returned from the Workman Gallery to pay for the painting--which, by the way, I really like.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_002">It's so nice to know you like something immediately and don't have to sneak up on it for another look to make up your mind!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_003">Anyway, I was asking Wally about her gallery--she's been in business for 20 yrs, and I'm sure in that time there were some really bad times for her here in Austin.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_004">I was telling her about you, and she said the woman who owns Sloan Jordan Gal. in the arboretum is an attorney here in town, and is sure she must have a business manager to run the place.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_005">(Gail or Gayle something.)
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_006">Anyway, she said we should call her and invite her to lunch so you could talk with her.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_007">K, J &amp; G are coming in Sat. for Karin's haircut.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_008">Always anxious to see Grayson.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_009">Hope our tickets to "Chorus Line" are good.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_010">I'm really looking forward to it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_011">The performance starts at 2:30--a decent hour for you to get here.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_012">We can go out for drinks and dinner afterward.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_013">Glad your painting turned out well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS045_014">Looking forward to seeing what a difference it makes.
