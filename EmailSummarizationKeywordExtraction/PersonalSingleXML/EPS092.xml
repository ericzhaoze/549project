</subject><text><sentence id="EPS092_001">Being that our commish is off in Vegas gambling off our league fees and I do not know whether he is going to view any transaction requests this weekend, I am letting you guys (and gal) know that I have put in a request to pick up Olandis Gary and Drop Tony Richardson from my lineup.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS092_002">If the transaction goes through, I wish to start Gary and Hambrick and RB this week.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS092_003">If the transaction does not go through, then my lineup remains as posted on the league website (Hambrick and James Stewart).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS092_004">I'm hurting at RB this week.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS092_005">Anyone interested in a trade (I need a RB)?
