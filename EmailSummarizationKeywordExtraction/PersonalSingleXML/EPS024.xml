</subject><text><sentence id="EPS024_001">bonjour girls- am relishing the balmy london weather- today: 73 degrees and breezy- and no rain to speak of.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_002">sorry- had to rub it in a little.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_003">anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was visiting in london.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_004">he is a producer working for animal planet doing documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_005">now he's coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and emailed me to let me know, since he's "helping" dad find the ultimate female GSP.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_006">so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names and phone #s.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_007">kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has already given him your #.  am not sure.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_008">but anyways, he is really nice, easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night out.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS024_009">just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little hostesses!
