</subject><text><sentence id="EPS043_001">Hi, Sal.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_002">Just talked with Cindy and she said you're still trying to work out weekend plans.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_003">I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to have you here, please don't make it too hard on yourself.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_004">Don't pressure yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_005">If you don't come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy is sure to erupt in the near future!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_006">Either way is great.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_007">Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions and I cannot fit into my pants!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_008">Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_009">But I couldn't figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit around?)
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_010">Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a mattress pad.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_011">Is that what it is for?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS043_012">I know you explained all of this to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!
