</subject><text><sentence id="EPS079_001">Good morning,  I'd love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_002">This morning I am kinda under some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I really don't have much spare time right now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_003">JA would flip out if I left for coffee now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_004">Maybe later this afternoon?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_005">Or tomorrow morning?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_006">Anyhow, another ride sounds really cool.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_007">I had lots of fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_008">And yes, it would be cooler if I didn't have to worry about work.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_009">Let me know when you have extra time to go for a ride.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_010">My weekend was pretty fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_011">I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the first time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_012">It looks so bad.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_013">I so don't know anything about lawn care.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_014">Also I planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy, but it s worth a try.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_015">Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_016">It's pretty cool.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_017">I bought some step-in switch boots, too.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_018">Cool, eh?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS079_019">So I'll talk to you later.
