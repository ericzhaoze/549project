</to><subject>hi guys!!
</subject><text><sentence id="EPS034_001">Just wanted to drop a quick note to tell everyone hello and to let you know my new contact information.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_002">Clay and I are living in my parent's backhouse (room w/ bathroom and kitchenette over the garage) while we work in Dallas for the summer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_003">Our number there is 214-691-3638 and Clay's cell is 214-649-6914.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_004">My work email is jessica.pulliam@bakerbotts.com and my work number is 214-953-6532.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_005">Hope you all are doing well--I have had a great first few days of work.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_006">But things have been busy as usual--throwing a 50th Birthday party for my mom on Thursday--"Come as Jeanie" (the theme is a suprise)--should be pretty funny!!  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_007">On a heavier note, my gradmother Mimi (mom's mom) had a stoke on Monday which left her totally paralyzed on one side and unable to eat.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_008">She decided not to go into the hospital (she hadn't been doing too well) so we should lose her in the next couple of weeks--I would appreciate very much your prayers for my family on that front.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_009">I am comforted in that Mimi is still coherent enough to understand what is going on and in that my mom seems to be at peace with the whole thing.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS034_010">Anyway, Clay and I are great--we are looking forward to a wild summer and I hope this note has found you guys doing well.
</sentence><signature>Much love to you all, bate</signature></text></email></thread></root>
