</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_002">That's way cool.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_003">Sounds like you are really doing well out there.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_004">Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_005">Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_006">Regardless, they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_007">I got back from Italy in Feb.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_008">I started school here in Newport, RI.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_009">Next I'l spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_010">Then, I'll meet my ship in the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_011">I'm getting pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two years.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_012">Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_013">Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born 4/15/99).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_014">I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate is too big to cuddle.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_015">Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.

</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_021">John is working semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing boats.

</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_024">Mark is the biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library science and information technology.

</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_026">Hey good to hear from you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS067_027">don't know when/how we can work in a visit.
