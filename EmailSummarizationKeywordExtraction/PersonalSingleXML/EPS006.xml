</subject><text><sentence id="EPS006_001">I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed working with you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_002">I loved the Company and what it stood for.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_003">I think it stood for the right things and in the end those right things will win the day -- even in California -- it just may take a long time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_004">I had a great time working for Enron, and the Government Affairs organization, built by you and Rick, was truly awesome.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_005">It was an honor to work with you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_006">But on a personal note, I was shocked and disappointed to be one of those chosen to be terminated Monday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_007">Further, I think what the Company is doing to all its laid-off employees is beyond despicable.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_008">It was a total slap in the face to be terminated with no severance -- the $4500 is a slap in the face -- basically a week's pay for me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_009">I wish those in charge paid as much attention to "enron's values" as its employees did.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_010">I'm getting beyond my anger now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_011">I plan to be an independent consultant -- that way I can never be fired again!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS006_012">I'll let you know how it goes.
