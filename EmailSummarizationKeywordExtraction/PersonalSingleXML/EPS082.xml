</subject><text><sentence id="EPS082_001">i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS082_002">it really hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS082_003">i can't talk to you about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS082_004">once again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you wanted.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS082_005">but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS082_006">i love you!
