</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_002">I saw this sunrise from my place this morning.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_003">Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_004">It was so orange and pinkish.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_005">I wasn't here too late last night which ruled.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_006">Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster.

</sentence><sentence id="EPS041_008">I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways.
