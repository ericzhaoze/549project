</sentence><sentence id="EPS025_003">I am really going to miss it, but the reality is that I am rarely there, and the I-need-to-start-saving-money-for-a-house side of me knows it is silly to keep paying rent.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS025_004">Oh, and I started a new job..
</sentence><sentence id="EPS025_005">I work at Exult now (ashley.streetman@exult.net).
