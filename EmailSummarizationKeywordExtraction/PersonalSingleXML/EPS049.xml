</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_002">Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be alarmed if you haven't received one.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_003">The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) 
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_004">What we were thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching Jimmy LaFave, who is performing at 10 p.m.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_005">He is one of Jennifer's favorites and we thought it would be a nice surprise.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_006">What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_007">Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_008">It will probably last until midnight.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_009">If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested in going, that would be great.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS049_010">Please don't mention this to Jennifer, we want to keep it a surprise.
