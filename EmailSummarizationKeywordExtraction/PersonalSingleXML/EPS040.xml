</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_003">djs   Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 days old.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_004">She brings me joy I never thought possible.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_005">And I'm sure some day she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_006">I didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_007">I am a different person (better) because of her.

</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_009">She gained  7 ounces!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_010">She's quite a good little eater.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_011">We are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_012">We'll probably make a trip down to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS040_013">I hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.
