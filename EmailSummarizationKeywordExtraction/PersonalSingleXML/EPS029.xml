</sentence><sentence id="EPS029_002">i wont mention it if you dont want me to.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS029_003">anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked to you in a while.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS029_004">as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!
