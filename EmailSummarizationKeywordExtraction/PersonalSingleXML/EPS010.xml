</subject><text><sentence id="EPS010_001">Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_002">What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy - in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the YO Ranch or somewhere.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_003">We might spend one night or two - plan something fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_004">Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_005">This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_006">Maybe we could "chip in" varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS010_007">Thoughts?
