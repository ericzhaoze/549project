</subject><text><sentence id="EPS028_001">I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_002">Well, I guess "they" are right . . .
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_003">Clay and I have some news.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_004">(No, I am not pregnant.)
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_005">But, we are buying a house in Dallas.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_006">We close on it two days after my arrival in London.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_007">Thankfully, Clay will still be here.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_008">We will rent it out over the next year while we are away.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_009">Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending on our tenants' situation.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_010">So, about the never say never part.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_011">The house is in south Highland Park.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_012">Gasp!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_013">We never expected to buy a house this soon.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_014">And, I NEVER--I repeat NEVER-- expected that we would move to Highland Park upon graduating from law school, if EVER!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_015">In fact, it was a condition of our marriage--I knew that we were going to end up in Dallas, but I made Clay promise that we would not have to settle in the Park Cities.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_016">He promised, crossed his heart, hoped to die, and the whole bit.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_017">All summer, we have been neighborhood shopping in Lakewood and East Dallas, an area that is close to downtown with wonderful homes and a sort of Austiny-feel.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_018">We spent some time checking out real estate cites on the web during our down-time at work, on a strictly just-for-fun basis.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_019">We loved looking at older homes.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_020">We dreamed about eventually getting something that was very livible for the time being but that would be really fun to update and restore.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_021">Independently, we both came across a house in south east Highland Park (near the McKinney and Knox Henderson area) that was built in 1925 in the Craftsman style--our favorite.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_022">We drove by it and checked it out on the internet for about three weeks.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_023">Finally, we decided to call up a realtor and go see it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_024">We immediately fell in love--wood floors, beautiful original fixtures and "rookwood" fireplace, 9 foot ceilings, great backyard, etc.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_025">During the three week period, I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal debate about living in this area.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_026">Would this mean I was destined to a life of suburban-driving, PTA morning, bubble head-ism???  
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_027">Would we ever be able to escape our parents who live merely 5-7 minutes away?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_028">Was I, deep-down, really a total snob?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_029">If not, would I become one?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_030">Would I have to go to the neighborhood Tom Thumb?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_031">Would I become my mother?
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_032">The bottom line was that we loved the house--the craftsman style lets us to combine Clay's desire for traditionalism and my love for modern design.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_033">(In other words, it's a place where my red leather couch and his stuffed deer head might live comfortable together.)
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_034">Also, we really loved the location (6 minutes from Downtown; right by our favorite restaurants and bar spots; and very close to the Katy Trail--Dallas' jogging biking trail).
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_035">So, I decided that we could make  Park Cities life work. . .
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_036">I would just have to concentrates on the things that I always have said I WILL do, rather than the things I have said I would NEVER do.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_037">I will invest in the lives of needy people; I will keep painting; I will remember that people, instead of things, make the world go 'round.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_038">After much prayer and consideration, Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball offer on the house.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_039">We negotiated for about a week, and the sellers finally accepted our offer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_040">We feel terribly blessed, and our prayer is that our home can be put to use for God's purposes.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_041">(And, perhaps, a TX-OU party??) I am thankful for a husband who was fortunate enough to save every penny he ever earned and every little birthday check he ever received--and for a father-in-law who helped us get an excellent interest rate.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_042">So, that's the news . . .
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_043">let the making fun of Jessica begin . . .
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_044">I certainly deserve it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_045">Too bad I am leaving the country in a matter of days!!! Hope you guys are doing well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_046">I will have email in London, so shoot me one whenever possible!
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_047">You can reach me via Clay's cell phone until Friday (214)649-6914.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_048">Sorry this message was so long.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS028_049">Much love and big hugs to you all.
