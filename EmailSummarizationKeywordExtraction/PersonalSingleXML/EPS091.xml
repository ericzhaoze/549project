</sentence><sentence id="EPS091_003">if we got two more we could split the price ($65 per) between the four of us.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS091_004">that would be about $30 per person to play.
</sentence><sentence id="EPS091_005">i realize everyone is probably working but we thought we would share, and allow you guys to play some golf with the uhhhfffllll league leaders and members of the best division in our league.
