</sentence><sentence id="APS006_002">It's been too long since our last visit, and I thought I'd write to you to see how everything is. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_003">So, how are you and the family doing? 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_004">If I remember correctly, Maggie is just about to start kindergarten, right? 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_005">That must be exciting; she was always such a bright girl. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_006">And what grade is Jeff going into? 7th or 8th? He's growing up so fast.
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_007">They both are, really.
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_008">My kids are getting ready for the school year as well. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_009">Max just mentioned you guys the other day while we were at the park. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_010">He remembered how Maggie was throwing the pebbles last time and asked when he'd get to play with her again. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_011">I really hope that I can tell him you'll all be visiting soon. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_012">You guys should drive up for a weekend out with us. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_013">There's a new restaurant in town, and I think you'd like it; it's very simple and cozy.  
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_014">We all miss you very much, Margret, and the family is welcome to come visit any time at all. 
</sentence><sentence id="APS006_015">I hope all is well with everyone. Please send hellos from all of us to your family.
