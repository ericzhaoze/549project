</subject><text><sentence id="APT013_001">Hey Sujatha, hows everything?
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_002">No updates?
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_003">Anyways, was looking at Dr. Mitra's profile at rate my professor and enjoyed what students have written there :P
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_004">http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=403804
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_005">Some gems:
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_006">* So conceited - hard to rationally argue with him about anything.
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_007">* Whenever any critique is made of his teaching style, he defends himself obsessively and refuses to listen.
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_008">He is childish and unintelligent.
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_009">* King of the eternal PPT (75-150 slides). Doesn't create them...borrows PPT's from other teachers from other universities (retarded).
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_010">* Basically...he says that a lot.
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_011">* poorly organized, no experience in the field that he was teaching
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_012">* he has no clue what hes talking about when hes lecuring, and it is obvious to everyone in the class
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_013">* The class involves him reading off slides or doing random/pointless problems.
</sentence><sentence id="APT013_014">Just replace teaching by research and it will look as if these comments were posted by us :( :)
