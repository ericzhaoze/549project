</subject><text><sentence id="APT007_005">It's fine. :-)  
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_006">I took a minor in Statistics.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_007">You remember, I had one minor in Computational Science.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_008">I took another in Statistics (it's 5 STAT courses - STAT 501, 505, 506, 557, and 463 - that I completed already).
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_009">Today I went to campus to get the minor form signed by Mitra ji, then I had to get it signed by STAT grad chair (Runze Li), then I submitted it to Kern building.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_010">I met Sujatha in IST, and we had a chat.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_011">Then on my way back, I met Juan and had a chat as well.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_012">Looks like Juan is here for a week or something, to attend one of his friends' wedding.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_013">He and his wife are doing well in Bogota. :-) :-)
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_014">I don't know if I told you about my defense. :)
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_015">Although I didn't need a thesis defense for M.E., I needed to submit and defend one paper.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_016">So I defended the CICLING one. Dr Mitra agreed to be on the committee, and then he told me to get Wang-Chien Lee serve on the committee as well.
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_017">Fortunately, W.C. Lee agreed. This defense was done on last to last Thursday (May 24).
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_018">So now, my graduation requirements are finally over. :-) :-)
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_019">How are you doing ?  
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_020">I heard that you went to Microsoft Redmond, right ?? :-) 
</sentence><sentence id="APT007_021">Have a nice time :-) :-)
