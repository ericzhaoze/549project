</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_003">She does not seem to stay very long in one position.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_004">I would question why?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_005">Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_006">Love, Mom I have Alyssa with me for three days.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_007">She talked about you all night last night.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_008">I'm not sure why.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_009">She really wants you at her birthday party.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_015">As you know, we rotate every six months.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_016">The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_017">Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_022">On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_023">I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_024">Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_025">It gave me some good insight.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT002_026">Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.
