</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_002">Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and  have  been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're  riding  public transportation.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_003">Anyway, I was writing to see if you might  have  some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_004">One  of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend  in  your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_005">I hope you're  still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_006">It looks  like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing  for you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_007">I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to  offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to  live  in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of  a  research trip for me).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_008">If you could start thinking of suggestions  for  restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and  maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.
</sentence><signature> Thanks a bunch,  Susan </signature></text></email><email order="2"><date> Thu, 30 Aug 2001 12:15:47 -0700 (PDT)</date><from>   "Bonnie Lathram" &lt;blathram@LMNArchitects.com@ENRON</from><to>     Scott, Susan M.</to><subject>  more seattle advice</subject><text><sentence id="EPT032_009">hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_010">when  i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have  info  on that sort of thing in seattle.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_011">if you have a sec, you may want to  try  seattleinsider.com---
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_012">i think they are supposed to be pretty good and  helpful   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the  weekend unfortunately....   
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_013">i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,  and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday  night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to  do!   
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_014">the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle  you  never know.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_015">my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for  sure, or a pullover or something.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_016">it gets so darn cold at night-  believe  me you will be glad.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_017">plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it  could  get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_018">ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_019">definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on  friday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_020">the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me  anytime  on it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_021">if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a  message and ill call you back.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_022">very exciting to have visitors from texas.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_023">see you friday hopefully.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_024">oh, where are you staying?

</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_026">I'll give you a  call  on your cell phone when we get to town.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_033">we were up in the mountains and it was chilly  and kind of cloudy (but really nice- we saw a black bear and a few  rainbows)- just gorgeous

</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_038">It's been really busy here lately.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_039">You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up kayaking.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_040">Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_041">It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_042">The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_043">The Market was fantastic.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_044">We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_045">We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_046">Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_047">It be great to see you again.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_049">i am not disappointed that you didnt go kayaking- are you kidding?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_050">ive been here 6 months and havent done it yet!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_051">so glad yall liked the market and "the bite"...  
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_052">i think the seattle market is so neat.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_053">some of those people travel 2 hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits, flowers, etc. alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to "make it" in america- all the "stalls" where they sell fish, etc are great small business success stories.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_054">that's why i like supporting it...  
</sentence><sentence id="EPT032_055">take care
