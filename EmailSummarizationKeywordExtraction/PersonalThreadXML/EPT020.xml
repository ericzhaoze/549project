</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_002">Absolutely!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_003">I  don't  know what I'm going to do with all my free  time  the  next several weeks (after getting Wallace's  scary  final out of the way).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_004">It's a good thing that  we  have  some major family holidays in the way.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_005">I don't know about Henry's, though.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_006">How  about  Chez  Panisse, or some place in the City: La Strada  or  Moose's?

</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_012">And I  should likely do a wee bit of scenario  analysis  on  the spreadsheet.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_013">Should I do that and then just email to Nancy?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_014">Chris could you forward  me the final presentation?

</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_017">Jeff, are you insistent on  tinkering  with  the spreadsheet, or shall we submit as is?

</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_044">Naturally, my mind leaps readily to the vulgar and  prurient: I could guess that one would use such a  device if one were kissing ass so deeply that one  would suffocate without a piped-in air supply  (crikey!), but then, having a snorkel in one's mouth  would render one unable to kiss effectively--ass or  otherwise--thereby defeating the purpose of said  object.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT020_046">With practice, one should  get along fine without additional devices.
