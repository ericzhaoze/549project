</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_002">the raiders beat us  at  our  own  game, gruden has had a lot of time to study shanny's  offensive  system.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_003">rhodes' defense looks exactly like robinson's, lets blitz  everyone  on  every play, which works well if you get to the qb, but  fails  otherwise.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_004">i thought it might be that they just haven't had time to  jell,  but  i'm  really starting to wonder about that.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_005">and where the  fuck is  peder.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_006">he's disappeared.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_007">hopefully t.d. is back for good, he  was  the  only  good thing to come out of monday night.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_008">t.d. . . .
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_009">return  us  to  the  promised land, or bring back THE MAN, everyone's coming  out  of  retirement these days.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_024">i  think it  might be osama bin peder. he disappeared right after this  thing  happened,  and he and i were talking about this sort thing in vegas right  before  it  happened.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT045_025">maybe we should find him, get him drunk with his  pants  around  his  ankles, and put him in on the broncos' defensive line. he  defeinately  couldn't do any worse.
