</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_002">It was a wonderful surprise to see.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_003">Now about the  shrimp, all you have to do is this....   
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_004">Since we were only able to send a few shrimp, all you need to do is  mix   1 cup of buttermilk &amp; 1 egg (this is the batter)    
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_005">Then take 1 cup of flour and season to taste with cayenne pepper,  black  pepper &amp; garlic salt.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_006">If you aren't comfortable with your seasoned  flour mixture just season the shrimp a little before dipping them into  the batter and flour.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_007">You can tell when they are done cause the will  be  a nice golden brown (ugh, make my mouth water) :)   
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_008">We had such a good time; you just have to come next time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_009">Kevin said  when he comes in Nov. (hopefully I will be able to come too) he is  going  to bring some shrimp with him.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_010">Just giving you something to look  forward to.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_011">Anyway I be emailing you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT011_012">Love ya.
