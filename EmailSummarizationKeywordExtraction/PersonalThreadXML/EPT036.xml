</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_002">They're only open 'til 7 tonight and I have a DiverseWorks meeting at 6.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_003">Not sure if I will make it over there today.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_004">Could probably go at lunch tomorrow.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_005">Question: when to set the trap?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_006">Shall we at least appease him with a little food on the back porch first, maybe something really stinky and canned?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_007">That will give him a chance to develop a taste for the salmon, tuna, whatever we bait the trap with; plus it might get him to shut up.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_008">Then we can set the trap when there is time to take him to the shelter.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_009">I figure it is probably best not to trap him during the wee hours; we have probably not yet heard Mr. Mouse at his loudest.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_010">Comments?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_011">Any advice from Trapper Craig?

</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_013">we should be as cruel as possible and just stick something out there when we are ready to take him in...
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_014">he seemed pretty willing the last time (although he may be smarter now that he is fatter and not seemingly as hungry) Trapper Craig probably knows the best procedure though, so I will defer to his suggestions...

</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_016">A hungry cat is a motivated cat!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_017">If it does not work, we can put food out sans trap and get his confidence, then use the trap.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_018">I think mouse will go for the canned food -the stinkier the better.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_019">Assuming Mouse is caught - what then?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT036_020">SPCA and the likely result or do we relocate him to, lets say, Pasadena?
