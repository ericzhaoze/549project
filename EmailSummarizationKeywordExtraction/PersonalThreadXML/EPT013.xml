</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_002">B.J. Johnson.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_003">Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_004">Was a year a head  of us.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_005">Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they  were rooming together.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_006">Went to lawschool a few years after me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_007">Is out and  doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_008">Nice guy.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_009">He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_010">His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_011">Looking  for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out  there not to shoot deer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_012">He has two small girls, is busier than I am and  would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_013">He is a good guy.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_014">Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I  don't care about that.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_015">Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_016">My thought is we could  proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up  taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two   spots to fill and less time to do it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_017">I think it might be best to offer this   spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be  the fall back plan.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_018">Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT013_020">I'd give him a  bid right away!!!
