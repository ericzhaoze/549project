</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_003">With Matt working here in Freight you probably already know  we are not well off these days.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_004">Next on the chopping block  is never a good place to be.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_005">This is a forward question but what the hell.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_006">I was  wondering if you knew of any positions available in your  area.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_007">If you can believe it I am not ready to leave Enron  behind yet.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT044_008">Thanks for your help.
