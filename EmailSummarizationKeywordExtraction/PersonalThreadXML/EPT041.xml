</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_010">Treeline  is  right by  my house, but we don't have to go there.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_011">Somewhere in a central  location  for everyone is fine.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_012">Throw out some names.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_013">Early is good,  that  way we can  watch my fantasy football kick someone's ass.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_015">As much as me and my colon will  miss "Brock  Dogs", I wouldn't mind another course.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_016">There is a pretty nice  course in  Crosby (Newport Country Club) which would be accomodating for  the  blues man  (Richard).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_017">The shorter drive for him ensures that he doesn't  get  too much  ass time which in turn allows me to kick more of it later that  day.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_018">Their  weekend rate is $25.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_019">They usually have an ad in the Chronicle  Sports  section.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_020">For once in my life, all of you are looking UP to me!!!!!

</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_033">Their first available tee  time is 1:15.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_034">Damn, and I was hoping Mark would wear his Hillrod wig.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_037">He asked about it, I looked it  up and got us a tee time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_038">If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere  else, that is fine with me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_039">Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee  times in Kingwood.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_040">With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood  is a happy medium.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_041">We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_042">Who the hell lives by Brock?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_043">I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is  better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_044">I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT041_045">It's  golf!!!!
