</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_002">you know, the housemate who used to tease you  about  asking out the flowerstand gal?   
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_003">i saw elliott mainzer a couple of days ago at a fundraiser for league of  conservation voters and was very happy to hear news of you. 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_004">he told me  you  moved to canada, that you've become a "super-analyst," and that you do a  lot  of yoga.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_005">sounds pretty good, especially the yoga part.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_006">i started up  again a  few months ago and feel so grateful for every class i take.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_007">i absolutely  love it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_008">even jake is starting to go once in a while, when he can fit it  in,  in between trying to finish up his dissertation and training for the  canadian ironman.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_009">speaking of canada, which city are you in? anywhere near vancouver?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_010">if this gets to you, let me know and i'll write more.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_011">i hope all's well with you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_012">cheers,     p.s. happy summer solstice.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_013">i hope you get the chance to get outside and  enjoy the long evening.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_014">i plan to celebrate by mountain-biking up and  around  mt.tam.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_016">i sometimes wonder what you and jake are up to - i'm happy you got in touch.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_017">ahhhh, the flowergirl - she still brings a smile to my face.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_018">(heh heh.i'm still a fool, if you're wondering.)
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_019">I'm in Calgary - unfortunately not close to Vancouver.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_020">it is near banff though, if you're coming up and have some time to spend. is the ironman in vancouver?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_021">when?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_022">sounds tough.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_023">what are you up to?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_024">What is WRHambrecht?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_025">financial?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_026">are you still editing? or writing?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_027">Is Jake still working on New Mexico public land etc. for his dissertation?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_028">wish i could have you guys over for dinner and catch up.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_029">i make it down to the bay area every once in awhile and will have to look you up next time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_030">yoga has been good!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_031">i've been doing almost entirely ashtanga lately, mostly because i haven't found a good teacher up here - i find ashtanga very tolerant of mediocre teaching.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_032">I found a great teacher in Portland - I think you would have dug her as she reminds me of you, come to think of it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_033">Not like any yoga I've taken in the past.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_034">very hard.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_035">she was a rock climber and distilled classes into really difficult and subtlely spiritual journeys.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_036">we would try some really hard poses - like scorpion.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_037">and handstands with pushups while you're vertical.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_038">lots of pranayama.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_039">she was one of these yogis who is 50 and looks like 30.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_040">where are you taking yoga down there?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_041">remember rodney yee? i'm going up to homer, alaska for a weekend retreat in july with him.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_042">i'm stoked.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_043">probably spend a week up there, not sure what i'm going to do.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_044">i miss california.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_045">it's a special place.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_046">i really miss the cheese board.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_047">i learned alot from you and jake and wish i still saw you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_048">i like calgary.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_049">it's sort of a man's town - like most midwestern towns.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_050">i don't think i fit in particularly well, but... not sure i would settle down here, but it's a pleasant place to spend some time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_051">the winters are brutal and the summers are glorious.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_052">unfortunately, we had a really shitty ski season last year.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_053">i had my hopes set on learning to telemark, but it didn't work out.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_054">canadians are great.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_055">they like to dis americans, but then who doesn't?  working at Enron has been good so far.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_056">it's odd to look back at working at the lab - i miss that time. it would be especially fun to work there now with all the focus on energy, although GW in the white house would make it difficult.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_057">like calgary, i'm not sure i'm comfortable settling down with Enron, but it's been worthwhile so far - not at all what i expected.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_058">when i started, no one knew what pknow what is going on and what exactly these corporations are up to.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_059">i usedower trading was about and now that it's in the news, even my mom wants to to spend alot of time analyzing the california power market and it was like watching a trainwreck in slow motion.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_060">i spend alot of time now staring at numbers.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_061">kind of a weird existence.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_062">can't attach alot of meaning to it, but it's challenging and satisfying.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_063">well, it's great to hear from you after all this time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_064">do you have a garden now? i've never had a garden like the one we had up on maybeck.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_065">i'm trying to grow some plants now, but it's tough in the middle of the city.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_066">keep in touch! and say hi to jake for me.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_068">and alaska in july with rodney yee! i'm jealous.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_069">i haven't taken a class with him, but many months ago i checked out some of his videos from the public library.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_070">i don't use the videos anymore, given that i like going to actual classes so much more, but it was a good way to ease back into practicing.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_071">i would love to take a class with him.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_072">whenever i check the schedule for piedmont yoga though, he's off in some far-flung place.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_073">maybe i'll just have to do one of the workshops with him someday...when exactly is the one in alaska?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_074">here, i usually go to the mill valley yoga studio, which is close to my house.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_075">there are 2 teachers there who i really like.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_076">they're very different, which is part of what i like.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_077">one sounds like your portland teacher.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_078">the other is more gentle.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_079">there's also another one who is such a lively spirit that her classes are fun and invigorating, even if less focused or rigorous.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_080">it sounds like you've gotten quite serious about yoga.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_081">do you practice every day?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_082">my brother scott (who i think you met once) also does a lot of yoga.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_083">now that he's moved back here from new mexico, after a sad divorce, i'm always trying to get him to talk with some of the cute, sexy women in the yoga classes, but, like you, he's very shy....  
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_084">speaking of which, being "a fool" is a good thing in my book, if by that you mean romantic and dreamy.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_085">but just remember, bold fools have more fun.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_086">do you remember that borges poem i had on my desk? the one that started (in translation): "if i had my life to live over again, i'd make more mistakes..." and then there's goethe, who wrote the oft-quoted: "whatever you dream you can do, begin it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_087">boldness has genuis, power and magic in it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_088">begin it now."
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_089">anyway...i'm babbling, as i'm prone to do.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_090">i'll write again soon and promise to answer more of your questions (i.e. about my work, jake's activities, etc.). 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_091">in the meantime, i need to get back to work.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_092">i will definitely stay in touch.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_093">we miss seeing you too.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_094">wouldn't it be great to have dinner again at that old picnic table outside, overlooking a garden in its prime?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_095">(to answer one more question, i do have a garden now, a small one, but it's in shade much of the day, so it's full of flowers rather than veggies.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_096">it's also got a large redwood and an inviting hammock underneath.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_097">and this time, instead of lily the dog as frequent visitor, we get oscar the cat).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT014_098">keep watering those plants.
