</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_008">I thought he was going to wait a  few  years  to move to SD but then I got Kari's e-mail.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_009">I know he and Carol have had  their eye  on SD for sometime.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_010">I guess we'll find out on the 11th!

</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_015">I wanted to make sure I had a better idea of  my  schedule.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_016">I am thinking the following..either the weekend of the 8th, 9th;  the  29th or 30th.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_017">I may go to Chicago the 15th or 22nd which I'll know about  within  the next couple of days thus one more weekend may open up.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_018">What are your  thoughts?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_019">Do you want to check Lari's schedule?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_020">Anyone else we should ask?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_021">We missed you on Sunday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_022">The whole gang was there minus Lisa.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_023">Carl leaves  in 2  weeks.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_024">They decided to move because he felt his career with the City would  never go where he wanted it to go.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_025">I can explain the rest later.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_027">those other dates, if they open up, i think  would work, too.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_028">i'm really sorry i missed you guys yesterday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_029">when kair  asked way back when, i had a conflict on that day.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_030">fine with me if we ask  others, though it's sort of fun when it's small, with like-minded folks.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_035">Give me just a couple of days to confirm the exact date.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_036">Go ahead and write Lari to see when she is available as she'll probably be the hardest person to juggle around.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_037">Now here is a question for you....
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_038">Rob has been wanting to go up to RRR and check it out but he'd probably be 1/2 day on the beach as other non-riders have been with us in the past.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_039">Would this be ok with you or shall I schedule with him for another time?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_040">I'm easy either way.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_041">Besides Rob the only other people could possibly be Jeff or Alice as the girls (Nora, Kari, Pat) are hot on the summer show circuit.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_042">I could always ask, just let me know.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_043">Would you like me to call the B&amp;B we stayed at and get their availability?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT015_044">What is the name?
