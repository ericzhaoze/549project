</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_002">This is Jeff, of course, once again having to decline the Tuesday night dinner invite.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_003">However, this month I am declining from a seat on United's flight 955 from London to San Fran.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_004">Isn't that special ;)?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_005">Believe it or not, this is relevant to you (all of you, not just Kari).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_006">That is because, as I was romping around England trying to escape my everyday working life, I spent three days at Porlock Vale on the West coast of the green isle riding some really nice horses.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_007">I am especially sorry that I can not join the dinner to share my experience.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_008">Now, I do recall some talk of taking a group holiday in England or Ireland in 2000.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_009">This is an unabashed attempt to persuade those interested in signing on to a stay at the Porlock house.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_010">Some of you may have already heard this stuff from Laura who was there a few years ago.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_011">The property is now owned by a bright and professional couple (Helen &amp; Kim) who were frequent guests until they succumb to the dreamy idea that they could escape their hectic London existence for one of country charm.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_012">From the return guests who were staying with me, the place hasn't changed much since the change in ownership.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_013">No one seemed to miss the former owners too terribly.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_014">The house and grounds were immaculate.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_015">The original house and stables were built in the 1930's for the hunt.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_016">It sits within the Exmoor National Forest, directly on the coast.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_017">My room's view was of the paddocks that bordered the beach.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_018">Across the Bristol channel, I could see South Wales - The local saying goes that, 'If you can see South Wales, it is going to rain.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_019">If you can't see South Wales, it is already raining'.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_020">I had my share of both - I could also see the village of Porlock through the trees.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_021">The house is everything you might think of as the stereotypical country English manner.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_022">Able to accommodate around 23 people, it is full of dark wood, overstuffed chairs, a fireplace, antique furniture and artwork.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_023">The common areas include three large sitting rooms, a dining room and a well-stocked bar.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_024">The guest rooms each have their own private bath (The plumbing works!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_025">Something that can not be taken for granted in England), Feather duvets, extra pillows, lots of lace and a coffee/tea service.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_026">Phones and TV's are also included for those who just can't stand it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_027">The property is about 20 acres. all of it well manicured.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_028">Flowering gardens surround the house.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_029">In addition to the original stable, there are a number of separate stalls, enough to house over 30 horses.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_030">Most of the land is in grass paddocks that also contain the cross country fences/obstacles Any number of courses could be set up with a tremendous variety of challenges and levels of difficulty - The property has been the training facility for several Olympic eventing teams.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_031">Also on the property are two indoor riding facilities, allowing for all weather riding.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_032">One is larger than a competition dressage arena where jumping classes are taught.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_033">The other is about one half the size of a dressage arena and used for flat lessons.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_034">The footing seemed good in both.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_035">As it sits with in the Exmoor National Forest, hacking in the woods is literally across the road from the house's entrance.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_036">Actually, we rode through the local village on several occasions to access the trails.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_037">It's not like there is a lot of traffic to negotiate.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_038">The Exmoor is made up of rolling land that borders the coast.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_039">We followed small roads and trails up heavily wooded ravines to the windswept tops of the moors.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_040">When the weather allowed, we had fantastic views of the ocean and the valleys with pastoral scenes of green farms dotted by sheep herds.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_041">The hacks always included a wild gallop through the heather.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_042">Aside from the grazing sheep, the moors are inhabited by wild ponies and red deer, both of which I saw.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_043">Back at the house, the guests are never lacking of energy due to poor nutrition (they might be hung-over, but never hungry).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_044">You will find better food and wine in San Francisco's restaurant scene, but the quality and variety of the Porlock house is really quite good.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_045">Breakfast consisted of fruits and cereal followed by a hot, traditional English fare.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_046">Dinner was a a white-linen, 4 course affair featuring fresh salads, local game and fish and deserts that were, frankly, obscene.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_047">They provide a good selection of wines as well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_048">Casual dress is appropriate, however, they do ask that you not wear your breeches to the table.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_049">And, that's about as stuffy as it gets.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_050">For all the tradition in the house, the owners and staff go out of their way to keep the mood lighthearted and jovial.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_051">Unless you've fallen in with the wrong crowd, you are going to have a great time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_052">Have I forgotten to mention the horses and instructors?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_053">Oh my.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_054">I am sorry to have kept you in suspense ...  The horses were great!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_055">For us GGPS folks, they are by far better than anything we've ridden lately.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_056">For you, "Oh, but of course I have my own horse in Marin" crowd, I don't think you will be disappointed.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_057">They are well-schooled, well-cared-for and happy to work.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_058">They are Irish and English bred thoroughbreds and warmbloods.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_059">I rode a couple of sensitive thoroughbred mares in flat lessons, and an equine version of a Sherman tank on the trails.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_060">I didn't see it myself, but apparently this guy was one heck of a jumper.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_061">With feet the size of dinner plates, he must land with quite an earth-shaking thud.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_062">I mean, this guy was BIG! My only concern about the horses was that (at least the three I rode) they all seemed heavy in the hands.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_063">All the horses I saw wore running martingales.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_064">It seems to be something common in the training there.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_065">Ok, ok, so I'm getting picky.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_066">The instructors, were also great.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_067">All the guests seemed happy with their lessons.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_068">Of the two instructors I had, both were better than what we normally see at GGPS (Will the Marin crowd please loose the smirks), and one was on par with Lisa McCluskey.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_069">I was very pleased.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_070">It seems that the instructors talk amongst themselves about the students.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_071">Several of us had the experience of changing instructors who made comments about our previous lessons.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_072">All hacks are led by someone from the stable (for the singers in the group, there is one girl who has some ditty going most of the ride).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_073">So my typical day was up at 7:00 to watch the sun rise (In December, it rises all day and never quite gets anywhere) and take a walk.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_074">At 8:30, breakfast was served.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_075">At 9:30, the first hack went out and the first lessons started.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_076">Lunch could be had at the house or a short drive took us to a couple of small villages where we would find the local pub.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_077">One has to remember that Guinness, while for strength, is not for enhancing one's riding in the afternoon.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_078">The last lessons begin at 3:30.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_079">Much to my pleasure, that left about 3 hours before dinner.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_080">Plenty of time for a nap, maybe some reading, a hot bath and tea, and then downstairs to sit by the fire and have cocktails with the other guests.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_081">Dinner was served at 7:30, followed by coffee and after-dinner drinks, again, by the fire.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_082">All-in-all, quite lovely.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_083">I am beginning to better understand the why the English so cherish tradition.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_084">If you were wealthy, it was a damn fine tradition.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_085">There is plenty for non-riders as well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_086">The Exmoor National Forest is just as accessible to hikers as it is to riders.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_087">At least two small villages are within 20 minutes walk.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_088">With a car, a lot of good touring could be done down the coast towards lands end.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_089">If one is low on motivation, hanging around the house would actually make for a fine day or two.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_090">And so, I've already told them that I will be bringing a small contingent of ex-colonists next summer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_091">Helen suggested early June, as it is before the heavy tourist season, but late enough that the cross-country courses should be dry for good footing.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_092">They do not like to accept groups of more than 8 people, you will need to bring a UK standard certified helmet for all but the flat work, and they have a strict weight limit of 189 pounds (they do turn down guests in excess) for riders.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_093">Discuss amongst yourselves.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_094">I'm sure we could have a good time somewhere else, but why risk it.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_096">I thought you were going to Porlock next year.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_097">Your summary of Porlock is just as I remember - Helen and Kim were in place when I visited.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_098">The manor house sounds just the same.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_099">The food, the riding, the treks, the pubs (...the hangovers).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_100">I even remember the horse with the dinner plate size feet.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_101">I didn't ride him myself, but I watched him go over a cross country course.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_102">In fact, I recall using the phrase "dinner plates" to describe the size of his shoes in my journal.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_103">I've never seen a horse with feet that big jump anything, let alone jump that well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_104">It was definitely a sight to see.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_105">And the gallops through the heather -- awesome.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_106">I've never experienced anything like it before or since.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_107">Once again, I highly recommend a visit to Porlock.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT043_108">I think even the Marin horse crowd will enjoy it.
