</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_004">He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the Women.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_005">Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could find him a game for the new system.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_006">He has said that he wants a new clock radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with battery backup -- Sony would be best.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_007">Also, he always wears short-sleeved Polo shirts, size XL.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_008">He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_009">Let me know if you need any other suggestions.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_010">We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_011">He always is talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_012">Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_018">I'm going to prob get Trey the Lyle CD and a playstation game.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_019">Maybe a Polo shirt

</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_021">I just need simple, basic frames.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_022">No decorations or anything.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_023">That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc. 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_024">So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_025">I could use 5x7" the most.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_026">Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_027">Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_028">I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_029">We are looking forward to your visit.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_030">Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_031">Do you and Marianne want to go?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_032">I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_033">Let me know.
</sentence><signature>See you later.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT017_035">Also, could you have Trey send us the grocery delivery service website?
