</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_016">My office address is fine.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_017">Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:  
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_018">1.I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_019">What happens if it jams in a blow? 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_020">2. Are the heads both electric?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_021">Will they operate manually if you lose power?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_022">3. The boat seems remarkably well equipped.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_023">What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise? 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_024">4. How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements? 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_025">5. Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_026">Any hope of a manufacturing change?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_027">Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT040_028">Lauderdale!
