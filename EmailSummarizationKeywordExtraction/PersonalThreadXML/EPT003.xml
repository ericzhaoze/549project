</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_002">I hope things are going  well  for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this  may  be a non event.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_003">CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_004">A  headhunter  set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_005">I spoke with Curt  Lizzi,  Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_006">I don't know why he agreed to  see  me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was  looking  for.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_007">He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_008">He  said  he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_009">You just  never  know.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_010">His number is 713-230-7205.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_011">Let me know how things are going.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_012">ME?? just focused on living in sin  with  a pregnant girlfriend.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_014">It's good to hear from you.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_015">Thanks for thinking about me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_016">I saw CMS's ad in Sunday's paper for that  position.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_017">I sent my resume to them in response to an ad back in  December,  and their HR folks called me in early January about an interview.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_018">Then  the  situation must have changed because then the HR lady acted like they  didn't  really have a position to fill after all.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_019">I've discovered that most HR  people are really lame (that's the nicest thing I can say!).
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_020">I'll call  Curt  Lizzi; however, I think you're more qualified to trade NE physical than  I  am.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_021">I'm probably better suited for Gulf Coast.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_022">I've been talking with Reliant and they may have a Gulf Coast position  available soon.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_023">I'm not thrilled about some of the people there, but  who  knows?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_024">Duke may have a Gulf Coast position available because someone  recently quit; however, Renato works there now so I'm SOL.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_025">I had a good  interview with them in late January when they didn't have the spot.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_026">Since  then, Renato has started with them in their origination group.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_027">Timing  is  everything!! Guess who Renato's working for?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_028">Eric Gonzales, formerly  of  Enron fame and fortune.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_029">He's Dan's old buddy.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_030">Robin might be interested in the CMS job.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_031">Is she still working estate  team  at Enron/UBS??
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_032">I haven't spoken with her since December.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_033">I've had very  little contact with anyone there.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_034">My last emails went unanswered, so I  decided to give up.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_035">Good luck with your baby!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_036">When is the due date?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_037">I know you are both  excited.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_038">It will be a real change in lifestyle but not a negative one,  believe me.
</sentence><signature> Take care,   Susan </signature></text></email><email order="3"><date> Mon, 8 Oct 2001 06:51:49 -0700 (PDT)</date><from> &lt;Chris.Germany@enron.com</from><to> &lt;pereira@houston.rr.com</to><subject> RE: Hey</subject><text><sentence id="EPT003_039">I told Robin about it and gave her Curt's name and number.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_040">I don't know if  she is following up with it or not.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_041">She's on the estate team with me.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_042">She  had back surgery 3 or 4 weeks ago.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_043">She was riding in the car one day and  her leg just went numb.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_044">She went to a couple of specialist and they both  said she needed surgery right away.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_045">She had a herniated disc?disk in her  back.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_046">Sorta like what I had but my leg never went numb, hurt like crazy  but no numbness.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_047">She just started working half days this week.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_048">Ingrid is doing pretty good.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_049">No problems so far!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_050">Our due date is May 7th.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_051">MAN IS SHE HANGING OUT THERE TOO!!!!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_052">We moved in together late February  and that seems to be going well.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_053">She didn't want to know the sex so we are  not sure if its male or female.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_054">I think little girls are adorable but I'm  smart enough to realize that all females are a pain in the rear end.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_055">And  my child's mother is no exception.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_056">She wants her last name to be the  baby's middle name.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_057">It doesn't sound good but what the heck.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_058">I think we  are going with Audrey Immer or Christopher Immer.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_059">I always wanted to be a  Christopher but I'm just a plain ol' Chris.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_060">Ed McMichael keeps saying we don't have enough people to do what needs to  be done.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_061">He hired Chris Figarow?, worked for Fred Lagrasta or Craig, back  on contract.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_062">I don't know how you feel about that but it might be  something to consider.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_063">His number is 713-853-7657.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_064">Take care and keep in touch.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_065">I'll keep you posted if I hear anything.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_066">Chances are that you will hear about it before me though.

</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_068">I hope she starts feeling better.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_069">This getting older stuff is for the birds!!
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_070">I hope everything goes well with the birth.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_071">You'll be pleased with a boy or a girl, I'm sure.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_072">Audrey and Christopher are both very nice names.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_073">By the way, my sister was a Judy, not Judith--my dad was responsible for that one.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_074">Have you called Scott H. about the CMS job?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_075">He might be a good match.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_076">When I last emailed with him, he said he was going to take some time off once he was done at EnergyUSA.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_077">As for working estate team, I don't think I could go back now.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_078">Who knows what horrible things I might say to Scott Neal??
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_079">He lied to me and was so incredibly spineless when he told me I "wasn't part of the team" back in December that I don't think I could stomach interacting with him on any level.. 
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_080">You're on a different floor from them, right?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_081">You probably still see some of the UBS people though.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_082">How is Judy?
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_083">I haven't heard from her in a long time.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_084">I emailed her a funny joke a while back but never heard anything else from her.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_085">Well, gotta go.
</sentence><sentence id="EPT003_086">Take care and say hello to Ingrid for me.
