</subject><text><sentence id="ECS046_001">here are the two new index descriptions that we need:  
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_002">For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top   
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_003">Then, just to clarify on the PG&amp;E Topock product -- here is the special language that we need to use -- 
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_004">"The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating conditions.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_005">The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_006">We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational constraints.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_007">I think this is close enough to the original language that it should not be a problem.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS046_008">Thanks for your help.
