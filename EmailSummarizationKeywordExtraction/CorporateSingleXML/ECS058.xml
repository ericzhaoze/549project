</subject><text><sentence id="ECS058_001">John,  Just a few things coming up:  
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_002">1. Elizabeth Shim - getting pretty negative feedback in her logistics rotation currently - this is now two rotations where she has not performed.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_003">Suggestion, that 1) she probably needs to rotate out of the Trading Track formally and 2) probably needs to find another home.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_004">Comments?
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_005">2. A London analyst is looking to come back to the US - has ranked well, currently in EBS.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_006">His resume is attached...
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_007">I would move to have him screened by two traders and interviewed on the 1st November along with everyone else (albeit by telephone).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_008">3. As you know, Emil Carlson is in Stockholm - not sure if you wanted to drop him a line.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_009">Let me know your thoughts on the above.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS058_010">Thanks,
