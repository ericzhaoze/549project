</sentence><sentence id="ECS001_002">I don't know what to tell her.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS001_003">Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to wait until the trade is done?
</sentence><sentence id="ECS001_004">I think the person that really needs to be handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS001_005">I am kinda just in the middle of the confirm thing.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS001_006">Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing with Roni.
