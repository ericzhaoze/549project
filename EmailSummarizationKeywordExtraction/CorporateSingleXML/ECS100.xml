</subject><text><sentence id="ECS100_001">Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_002">His work was top notch, his subcontractors did a great job.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_003">For instance, I put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_004">I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_005">Louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_006">Also, his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_007">You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_008">Louis is also a good businessman.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_009">He gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_010">A lot of contractors are not good businessmen.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_011">I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his additional time or money on.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS100_012">To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay.
