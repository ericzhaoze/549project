</subject><text><sentence id="ECS089_001">In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either party without consent.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS089_002">We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS089_003">Unless Federico has any reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead &amp; draft a waiver up here and send it to Duke.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS089_004">Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.
