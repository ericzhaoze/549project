</subject><text><sentence id="ECS098_001">In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap Agreement Database.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_002">Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the information.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_003">This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_004">The only information we need to continue to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client privilege issues).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_005">Access to this information would continue to be limited to Legal and Credit  
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_006">In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and Credit have access to the Portland General masters.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_007">Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_008">Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to have this information and access available by that time.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_009">In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_010">Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the changes.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS098_011">Thanks for your help!
