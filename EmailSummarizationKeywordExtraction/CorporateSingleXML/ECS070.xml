</subject><text><sentence id="ECS070_001">I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_002">The presentation was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and swap agreement form templates.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_003">I need to talk to our confirm desk people to see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were hoping this system could address.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_004">They had one concept for form generation I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_005">The concept was this "data dictionary".
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_006">It made it all clear to me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS070_007">I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come back to us before I leave for Europe in June.
