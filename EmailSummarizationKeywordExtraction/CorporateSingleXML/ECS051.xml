</sentence><sentence id="ECS051_003">I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS051_004">Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS051_005">Let me know what you think.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS051_006">Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?
