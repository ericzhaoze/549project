</subject><text><sentence id="ECS073_001">Paige - I can be more argumentative here but if it's not going to make any difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS073_002">Let me know if you disagree.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS073_003">While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment which may be payable to the defaulting party.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS073_004">An event of default and resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, etc.).
