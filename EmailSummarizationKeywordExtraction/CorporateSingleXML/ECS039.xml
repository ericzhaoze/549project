</subject><text><sentence id="ECS039_001">Peter,  Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_002">Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we have in our form, so we're changing our form.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_003">You are the man!
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_004">I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok there.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_005">I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving holidays.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_006">If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to be reachable.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_007">Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, Taffy will have the number).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS039_008">Let me know if I can be of further help today!
