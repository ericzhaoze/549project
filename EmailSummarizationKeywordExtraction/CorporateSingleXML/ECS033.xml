</subject><text><sentence id="ECS033_001">During June, Coral transacted on EOL.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_002">However, they selected a July thru October deal by mistake.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_003">The marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in EOL.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_004">Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_005">But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_006">Logistics will be brokering the transactions in MOPS.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_007">Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_008">Again, they will not have a record of the deals.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_009">The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS033_010">Let me know if you have any questions.
