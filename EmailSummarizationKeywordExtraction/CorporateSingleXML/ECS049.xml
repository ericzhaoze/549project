</subject><text><sentence id="ECS049_001">Vince,  Thank you so much for meeting with me Friday morning about the Research Group.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_002">After leaving your office, I remembered an issue I have had with the Analyst &amp; Associate Program that might be of interest to you.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_003">During a Texas A&amp;M recruiting meeting, I learned that we have expanded our list of majors to include computer science.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_004">I wondered why math majors were not mentioned, and was told that there was not a business need for math majors.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_005">Like liberal arts majors, they said math majors were only considered on a person by person basis.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_006">In my opinion, math majors have many of the same skills as finance majors, and can easily adjust to accounting rotations as well (I did last summer, and finance majors in the program are forced to every year.)
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_007">I think that Enron is missing out on many qualified candidates by limiting their recruitment effort.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_008">At Texas A&amp;M the Career Center asks companies for a list of majors they are targeting, and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the career center.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_009">I sent my resume to Enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_010">However, many other math majors had not heard of Enron or the other companies, and assumed that there was no place for a math major at a company like Enron.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_011">Many math majors want to continue their education, become teachers,  or work for an actuarial firm.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_012">However, many are undecided.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_013">We are constantly told of the many business possibilities available to math majors by our teachers and staff, but many undergraduates are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business environment.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_014">By not mentioning math majors to the career center (a very simple and inexpensive step), Enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_015">While it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about Enron already, had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math majors would fit perfectly, and went the extra step to send Enron their resume outside the career center system, there are many qualified students who do not do this, and opt for other companies who DID mention math majors.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_016">I called a manager in the A&amp;A program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math majors to the career centers.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_017">I realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them, talk to teachers, and attend math society events.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_018">However, I told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for Enron.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_019">She reiterated that they saw no business need for math majors, and that if more upper level people began requesting them, it would be considered.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_020">I searched for "mathematics" on the Enron job website, and had a surprising number of results.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_021">I know that your group could use math majors as well.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_022">However, this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the A&amp;A recruiting department.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_023">I just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS049_024">Thanks,
