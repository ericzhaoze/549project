</sentence><sentence id="ECS054_003">Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be scheduling this deal as a zero nom.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS054_004">Hopefully, this will allow the demand charge to flow through the system.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS054_005">Let me know if you don't see this happening.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS054_006">For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the imbalance pool).
