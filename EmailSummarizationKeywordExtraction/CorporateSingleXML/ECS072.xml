</subject><text><sentence id="ECS072_001">I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_002">Late Friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of HPL.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_003">The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_004">Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at Gas Daily.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_005">I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday forward.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_006">Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS072_007">We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary.
