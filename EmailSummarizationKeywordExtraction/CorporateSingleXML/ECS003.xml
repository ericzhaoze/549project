</subject><text><sentence id="ECS003_001">I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the approved swap forms there.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_002">The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_003">I hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_004">Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc),industrial-canadian, etc..
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_005">I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_006">I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_007">If there is a form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_008">This should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS003_009">To the U.K. and Singapore:  We are going through a form revision process here in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies of the changes to you for your review.
