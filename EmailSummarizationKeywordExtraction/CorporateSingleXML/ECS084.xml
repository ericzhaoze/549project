</sentence><sentence id="ECS084_002">We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS084_003">In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:  1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS084_004">or 2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.
