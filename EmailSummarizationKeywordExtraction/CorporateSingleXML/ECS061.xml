</subject><text><sentence id="ECS061_001">B,  I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:  
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_002">1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to interview her.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_003">Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_004">Pat Clynes fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately called Toni to get it straightened out.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_005">Toni called me at home, which is good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to discuss information with me.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_006">2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_007">This has improved over the last week.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_008">She has called me a couple of times awaiting my decision on salary concerns.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_009">So, I think that she is trying to stay on top of this now.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS061_010">Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.
