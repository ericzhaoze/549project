</subject><text><sentence id="ECS109_001">John,  Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_002">I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_003">I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_004">The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been "trust the system until it fails you".
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_005">We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_006">Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_007">We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_008">Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law? No.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_009">However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_010">In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_011">I write you now to offer my version of justice.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_012">From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_013">At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_014">This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_015">Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_016">My situation is certainly unique.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_017">I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_018">To this I have four responses: 
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_019">(1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; 
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_020">(2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_021">It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; 
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_022">(3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year; and 
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_023">(4) Despite my expectation of zero bonus I have continued to work diligently (including nights and weekends at your suggestion) at rebuilding this team.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_024">Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_025">You may need to make decisions on who to keep.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_026">Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_027">John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_028">I will be as patient as I can be.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS109_029">Sincerely, 
</sentence><signature>Keith</signature></text></email></thread></root>
