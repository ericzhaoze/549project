</subject><text><sentence id="ECS014_001">I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS014_002">When a traveller is placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS014_003">If you wait for the provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the person on the phone before anyone on the list.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS014_004">Other agents have done this for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.
