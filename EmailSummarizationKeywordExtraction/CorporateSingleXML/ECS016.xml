</subject><text><sentence id="ECS016_001">I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_002">Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_003">This is where Livelink comes in.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_004">Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_005">In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_006">In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_007">Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_008">This is where you and your group comes into play.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_009">Becky and I don't want to put "junk" into it.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_010">We want what's relevant to you and your team.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_011">Of course, this is all relative.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_012">What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_013">We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_014">Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS016_015">Thanks,
