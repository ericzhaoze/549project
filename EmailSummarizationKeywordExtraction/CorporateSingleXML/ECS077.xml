</subject><text><sentence id="ECS077_001">Here are my draftversions of the weather GTC's.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_002">Since Enron North America will be the Enron contracting entity for all of the transactions, I have expanded the documents to allow for European as well as U.S. transactions and to allow for multiple weather station (index) deals or single weather station deals.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_003">The option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be specified on the web site.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_004">I think it would make sense for one of the weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they agree that they work.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_005">I'm hoping to sit down with Mark Dilworth in the morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete - when you look at these forms, it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on the web site: Premium, Effective Date, Termination Date, Reference Weather Station(s), Fallback Reference Weather Station(s), Reference Basis, Reference Degrees (C or F), Strike Amount, Notional Amount and Maximum Payout Limit are the terms I have identified so far.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_006">Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_007">There are blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate agencies are.
</sentence><sentence id="ECS077_008">I have not spelled out the data sources for the European transactions either.
